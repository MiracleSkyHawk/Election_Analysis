## Election-Audit Summary
This script can be modified and used for analyzing any election results. Examples of how the code can be modified are shown below.

1. For other elections, the level of municipality may be changed. Therefore, the hard-coded strings that are printed to the terminal and saved to the txt file should be changed according to the correct municipal level. 

2. If the csv file fed to the script is in different format or has new columns, the indexing of the list variables needs to be adjusted.
